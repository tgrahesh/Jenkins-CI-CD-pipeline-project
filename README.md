# CI/CD Pipeline for a Hybrid Application: Microservices and Serverless

## Project Overview

This project provides an outline of the steps to create a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate the building, testing, and deployment of a hybrid application that includes microservices deployed on Kubernetes and serverless components on AWS Lambda.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Jenkins server set up and configured.
- A Kubernetes cluster ready for microservices deployment.
- AWS account and the necessary IAM roles for serverless deployment.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Define Your Application Architecture

Document your application architecture, including microservices and serverless components. Make a clear plan of how they interact and what needs to be deployed where.

### 2. Set Up Version Control

Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage your application code. Create a repository and commit your code to it.

### 3. Configure Jenkins

Install Jenkins on a dedicated server or cloud instance. Install the required plugins, including AWS and Kubernetes plugins. Set up Jenkins credentials for AWS and Kubernetes.

### 4. Implement Automated Testing

Create automated tests for your application components, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Configure Jenkins to run tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

### 5. Kubernetes Deployment

Write Kubernetes YAML files for deploying your microservices. Create deployment scripts or Helm charts for each microservice. Configure Jenkins jobs to deploy microservices to the Kubernetes cluster.

### 6. Develop Serverless Functions

Create serverless functions using AWS Lambda. Implement and configure the functions, along with any necessary triggers (e.g., API Gateway).

### 7. Serverless Deployment

Use a serverless framework (e.g., Serverless Framework) to package and deploy your serverless functions. Configure Jenkins jobs to deploy serverless functions.

### 8. Continuous Integration

Configure Jenkins for continuous integration. It should build, test, and package your application on code commits. Ensure that all tests pass before proceeding.

### 9. Implement Staging Environment

Set up a staging environment for testing new releases. Configure Jenkins jobs to automatically deploy new microservices and serverless functions to the staging environment after successful builds and tests.

### 10. Staging Testing

Conduct comprehensive testing in the staging environment, including integration testing and user acceptance testing.

### 11. Production Deployment

Configure Jenkins to automatically deploy to the production environment after successful testing in staging. Implement a safe deployment strategy (e.g., blue-green or canary) to minimize production impact.

### 12. Continuous Monitoring

Set up monitoring and logging for your microservices and serverless functions. Implement alerting for system and application metrics.

### 13. Security

Implement security best practices, including code scanning, access control, and secure handling of secrets.

### 14. Scalability

Plan for scalability. Ensure your infrastructure can handle growing workloads.

### 15. Documentation

Create comprehensive documentation for your CI/CD pipeline, including setup, configurations, and maintenance procedures.

### 16. Backup and Disaster Recovery

Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures to ensure data and application integrity in case of failures.
